Thanks for your interest in contributing to feature! A few notes on what I'm
looking for:

-   Things to do:
    -   Add missing test coverage.
    -   Add generic Toggles - see [IPWhitelist](src/Toggles/IPWhitelist.php) for
        the idea - basically pass arguments in with __construct.

In general,

-   While this project is in 0.x, please send PRs to the master branch and
    propose new features in an issue (just in case we need to discuss),
-   Adopted coding standard is a loose PSR-2,
-   Please add tests with new features, and regression tests for bug fixes,
-   Before you start coding - create a topic branch for your feature/fix,
-   Squash commits in pull requests to meaningful changes and create a pull
    request for each feature/fix.
